            <p>Women have struggled in our society for years and it's time we acknowledge and help those who have experienced inequality. The Women's Rights movement has been a movement since 1950. Women have fought for justice since the 50's here in the United States. In other countries, it is very limited what women can do. In some cultures, women are the ones that have to be at home and care for children and maintain their homes. There have been lots of mysogonistic views that believe women aren't capable of what men do. </p>
            
          <p>  From 1960-1970, the fight for equal rights was liberated for women in the United States. </p>
